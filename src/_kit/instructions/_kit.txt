Thank you for downloading the Stitch Starter Kit!

To make things as easy as possible, all temporary files for setting up the kit can be found in the _kit directory.
In here, you can find the instructions and temporary styles to help you get a project off the ground as quick as
possible.

Whenever you merge a branch, that branches instructions and styles (if applicable) will be in the kit, meaning you
can go through the instructions, top to bottom, and have a project ready to start at the end of it. If you want, you
can include the temporary styles in your project as well. They come in CSS, LESS and SASS versions, and are consistent
with the CodeStitch naming conventions

TO GET STARTED:
1. Merge all the branches you wish to use with this kit
    - Remember: you can use one style/, one page/, and as many feature/'s as you want

2. Run npm install

3. Handle the _kit/styles folder
    - If you're using one of the Stitch Starter's style/ branches, this folder can just be deleted
    - If you're not using one of the Stitch Starter's style/ branches, we offer CSS, LESS and SASS versions of all
      files in _styles. Feel free to use the styles you need

4. Delete the {% include ... %}'s for the starting styles from _includes/layouts/base.html

5. Delete this file and move on to the next one!
