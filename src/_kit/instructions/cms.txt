This module adds Netlify CMS to the project. By default, it's set up in a blog-style format however, this can be expanded for a whole
range of use cases, including menus, vacancy boards or anything which would require modification from a non-technical client.

To prevent clashes while merging branches, there's no link in the navigation to the posts page. You can visit it at localhost:8080/posts,
where we have provided three example posts to demonstrate the use of the CMS. You can access the CMS at localhost:8080/admin.

1. Add link to /posts to the header.
    - If you're using a /pages branch, add the front matter template to the posts page.
