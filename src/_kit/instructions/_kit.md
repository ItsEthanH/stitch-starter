# Thank you for downloading the Stitch Starter Kit!

To make things as easy as possible, all temporary files for setting up the kit can be found in the \_kit directory. In
here, you can find the instructions and temporary styles to help you get a project off the ground as quick as possible.

Whenever you merge a branch, a markdown file for that branch will be put in \_kit/instructions, outlining how to use
that branch. When all branches are merged, just go through the instruction files, follow them and delete them when
you're done. When the folder is empty, you're ready to go!

There is also a styles folder, giving some starting styles for the header, footer and branch-specific features. Each
folder comes in CSS, SASS and LESS variations, so you can either incorporate them into your existing styles, or just
delete them. If you merge a style/ branch, the starter styles will already be set up for you.

## TO GET STARTED:

1. Merge all the branches you wish to use with this kit

   - Remember: you can use one style/, one page/, and as many feature/'s as you want

2. Run npm install

3. Handle the \_kit/styles folder. Either incorporate the styles into your project, or delete them and start from
   scratch.

   - If you're using one of Stitch Starter's style/ branches, the starter-styles are already included. You still need to
     decide on how you would like to handle branch-specific styles, however.

4. Delete the {% include ... %}'s for the starting styles from \_includes/layouts/base.html

5. Delete this file and move on to the next one!
