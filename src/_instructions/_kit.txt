Thank you for downloading the Stitch Starter Kit!

To make things as easy as possible, all instructions can be found in this folder. Whenever you merge a branch,
that branches instructions will come into this folder. That means you can just go through the files, top to bottom,
and delete the .txt's as you go along. When the folder is clear, the kit is ready to go!

1. Merge all the branches you wish to use with this kit
    - Remember: you can use one style/, one page/, and as many feature/'s as you want

2. Run npm install

3. Handle the _includes/_styles folder
    - If you're using one of the Stitch Starter's style/ branches, this folder can just be deleted
    - If you're not using one of the Stitch Starter's style/ branches, we offer CSS, LESS and SASS versions of all
      files in _styles. Feel free to use the styles you need

4. Delete the {% include ... %}'s for the starting styles from _includes/layouts/base.html

5. Delete _instructions/_kit.txt and move on to the next one!
